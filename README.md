The idea is simple, this script will find all your files and apply rules to know if a file should be selected.

For example, all files that are older than 2020-01-01 which are bigger than 0.01 MB would be selected by default.

From that point there's two behaviors:
- The first one is to put all those files in a yearly folder (files from 2019 will 
be grouped in one folder). 
- The second one would be to delete all those selected files.

## Usage

1. Rename `config.yaml.dist` to `config.yaml`
2. Edit and add as many FTP you want.
3. Define your archiving rules within the archivatix.py
4. Run the script within the venv:
```sh
python archivatix.py
```
